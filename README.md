# ðŸ§  Algorithms: 24-Part Lecture Series â€” Java Implementations

This repository contains my Java implementations and notes from the *Algorithms* lecture series by **Robert Sedgewick**. It serves as a hands-on companion to the course, where I code along and deepen my understanding of core algorithmic concepts.

## ðŸ“¦ What You'll Find

As I progress through the lectures, I'll be adding:

- Java implementations of classic algorithms
- Key data structures and utilities
- Problem-solving techniques and optimizations
- Occasional notes or comments for clarity
